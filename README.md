## 🧪 Lab: AI Chat Evaluation & Feedback Lab


### 🔍 Purpose
This project simulates how I would evaluate AI-generated chat support logs, providing constructive feedback as part of a Merchant Support team. Reviewing these logs helps refine AI tools and ensure great customer experiences.

### 🛠️ What I Did
- Generated 5–10 simulated AI chats using common merchant questions.
- Analyzed each for clarity, empathy, and technical accuracy.
- Suggested improvements.

### 📁 File Breakdown
- `ai_chat_examples.md`: Sample AI-generated support chats.
- `my_feedback.md`: Critiques for each example.
- `better_responses.md`: Suggested improvements.
- `README.md`: This file.

### 💡 Evaluation Sample
> Issue: “My store won’t load on mobile.”
> 
> AI Response: “Try restarting your device.”
> 
> My Feedback: “Too generic. This misses key diagnostic steps. Better to ask about browser, cache, or recent app changes.”

### ✅ Skills Demonstrated
- AI quality assurance
- Communication auditing
- Writing constructive feedback
- Customer-first mindset
